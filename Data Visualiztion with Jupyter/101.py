##plt.plot generates a linechart with custom x and y axis
##plt.scatter generates a scatter plot which is useful to define correlation between variables. (is x up, y up, positive correlation)


##subplot are useful to compact different plots within one figure
##plt.subplot(rows, columns, number)
##plt.plot()   the "number" plot 
##this can get a unwieldy in terms of lines of code so it is usually a good candidate for a for loop

##plt.pie for a piechart of an x array plt.pie(x,labels startangle, colors)
